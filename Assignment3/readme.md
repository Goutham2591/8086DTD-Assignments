Morton Arboretum - OAK Tree Collection:

I would like to start with mentioning some interesting facts about the “OAK Tree” as our study is based on it. 
*	There are about 600 extant species of “oaks” and our Team’s study will be based on 40 of those that belong to the genus “Quercus”. OAK trees are widely found in Asia and North America where in North America contains the Largest number of “oak” species with an estimation of more than 90 species and Asia rank’s second with an approximation of 80 species. A wide variety of “oak” tree species are deciduous and most of them do not shed its leaves until spring. Adding to that, there are a very limited species of “oak” which are Evergreen and are generally found in the Mediterranean region.
* The usual life span of Oak Tree is around 200 years, whereas some trees live up to 1000 years. The “Pechanga Great Oak Tree” in the united states is 2000 years old and it is the oldest in the world. It belongs to the species “Quercus agrifolia” which is not a part of our study.
*	Oak has been chosen as a national tree for many countries such as USA in the year 2004, Germany, England, etc., it is considered as a common symbol of strength.
* Oak Tree has more strength and hardness. It has a high tannin content which makes it very resistant to fungal and insect attacks. Adding to that, they are used to manufacture ships, furniture’s, etc.
* Oaks are more likely struck by lightning than the other trees.
<ul><li>	There are three main or common types of “oak” trees </li>
   <ul> <li>White Oak - [Genus: Quercus]- [Species: Alba] </li>
   <ul> <li>	Native to North America, the tallest of all oak species </li>
<li>The branches of these trees usually spread over a large area </li>
<li>The leaves will turn red or brown during fall</li>
<li>Height: between 60 and 100 feet</li>
<li>	Width: 4 feet </li>
<li>Leaves: 4 to 9 inches long</li>
</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<ul><li>	Red Oak - [Genus: Quercus]- [Species: rubra]</li>
	<ul><li>Grow well in moist, well-drained slopes</li>
	<li>Leaves change from red to deep reddish-brown during fall</li>
	<li>Height: 50 – 80 feet</li>
	<li>Width: 2 – 3 feet</li>
	<li>Leaves: 5 to 9 inches long</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>

<ul><li>	Black Oak </li>
	<ul><li>Leaves turn bright red in the fall</li>
	<li>Leaves change from red to deep reddish-brown during fall</li>
	<li>	Height: 80 feet</li>
	<li>	Leaves: 4 to 8 inches long</li>
	</ul>


</ul>

* These trees generally are great shade trees and many of the species have a great fall color.
* To add more insight in to the data set which we have, I have done a research and collected information about how different species react to climatic conditions and other useful attributes. The fields that I have collected for different species includes the following.

<ul><li>Bloom time, which is a month field showing which month it blooms, </li>
<li>Bloom description, which describes the color of the leaves during a season. ex yellowish green.</li>
<li>Wild Life Value which describes how the wild life beings such as birds are being benefitted by oak trees.</li>
<li>Foliage, to capture whether the trees are deciduous or evergreen</li>
<li>Sun Preference, to understand if the tree requires more sunlight or not</li>
	<li>Sun Hours, Number of hours required for the tree to be in sun.</li>
<li>Soil Preference, to know what soil conditions that each species prefers and grows. Ex: moist, well-drained, acidic</li>
<li>Tree Type tells how the tree is used. Ex: Shade tree or Ornamental tree or Street Tree</li>
<li>Tree Name to record the actual name or non-scientifical name of the tree</li>
<li>Height and Width to know the minimum and maximum height and width of each species of oak</li>
