Morton Arboretum - OAK Tree Collection:

I would like to start with mentioning some interesting facts about the “OAK Tree” as our study is based on it. 
*	There are about 600 extant species of “oaks” and our Team’s study will be based on 40 of those that belong to the genus “Quercus”. OAK trees are widely found in Asia and North America where in North America contains the Largest number of “oak” species with an estimation of more than 90 species and Asia rank’s second with an approximation of 80 species. A wide variety of “oak” tree species are deciduous and most of them do not shed its leaves until spring. Adding to that, there are a very limited species of “oak” which are Evergreen and are generally found in the Mediterranean region.
