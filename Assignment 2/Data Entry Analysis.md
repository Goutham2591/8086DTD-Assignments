# Data Entry Analysis Assignment

# Task1
* The time [noon or night] during which the samples were collected is missing.
* Column names must be consistent across different sheets. As of now, the first document has a field named “z” which is misleading.
* What does missing values mean in Temperature column? Was it intentionally left blank or is it not recorded?
* Data organization is not consistent between these sheets. [number of fields are different for different sheets]
* Data collected for the year 2010 must be cleaned and reorganized.
* Data collected for the year 2010 is insufficient, so making a comparison for multiple years isn't possible[cannot compare 2010,2011 data]

# Task2
* Based on my observations in # Task 1, I have come up with this following table structure.
* I have added a new column "Day/ Night" to gather information about when the sample was collected.

| Date | Depth | Cuni #/L | Cuni ColonySize | Chippo #/L | Chippo ColonySize | Chla | Temperature | Day/Night |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|------|-------------|-----------|
|      |       |          |                 |            |                   |      |             |           |
|      |       |          |                 |            |                   |      |             |           |
|      |       |          |                 |            |                   |      |             |           |
