# Data Entry Analysis Assignment
•	The time [noon or night] during which the samples were collected is missing. 
•	Column names must be consistent across different sheets. As of now, the first document has a field named “z” which is misleading. 
•	What does missing values mean in Temperature column? Was it intentionally left blank or is it not recorded? 
•	Data organization is not consistent between these sheets. [number of fields are different for different sheets]
•	Data collected for the year 2010 must be cleaned and reorganized.
•	Data collected for the year 2010 is insufficient, so making a comparison for multiple years isn't possible[can't compare 2010, 2011 data]
